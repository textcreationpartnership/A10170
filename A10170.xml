            <p>EEBO-TCP is a partnership between the Universities of Michigan and Oxford and the publisher ProQuest to create accurately transcribed and encoded texts based on the image sets published by ProQuest via their Early English Books Online (EEBO) database (http://eebo.chadwyck.com). The general aim of EEBO-TCP is to encode one copy (usually the first edition) of every monographic English-language title published between 1473 and 1700 available in EEBO.</p>
            <p>EEBO-TCP aimed to produce large quantities of textual data within the usual project restraints of time and funding, and therefore chose to create diplomatic transcriptions (as opposed to critical editions) with light-touch, mainly structural encoding based on the Text Encoding Initiative (http://www.tei-c.org).</p>
            <p>The EEBO-TCP project was divided into two phases. The 25,368 texts created during Phase 1 of the project (2000-2009), initially available only to institutions that contributed to their creation, were released into the public domain on 1 January 2015. The approximately 40,000 texts produced during Phase 2 (2009- ), of which 34,963 had been released as of 2020, originally similarly restricted, were similarly freed from all restrictions on 1 August 2020. As of that date anyone is free to take and use these texts for any purpose (modify them, annotate them, distribute them, etc.). But we do respectfully request that due credit and attribution be given to their original source.</p>
            <p>Users should be aware of the process of creating the TCP texts, and therefore of any assumptions that can be made about the data.</p>
            <p>Text selection was based on the New Cambridge Bibliography of English Literature (NCBEL). If an author (or for an anonymous work, the title) appears in NCBEL, then their works are eligible for inclusion. Selection was intended to range over a wide variety of subject areas, to reflect the true nature of the print record of the period. In general, first editions of a works in English were prioritized, although there are a number of works in other languages, notably Latin and Welsh, included and sometimes a second or later edition of a work was chosen if there was a compelling reason to do so.</p>
            <p>Image sets were sent to external keying companies for transcription and basic encoding. Quality assurance was then carried out by editorial teams in Oxford and Michigan. 5% (or 5 pages, whichever is the greater) of each text was proofread for accuracy and those which did not meet QA standards were returned to the keyers to be redone. After proofreading, the encoding was enhanced and/or corrected and characters marked as illegible were corrected where possible up to a limit of 100 instances per text. Any remaining illegibles were encoded as &lt;gap&gt;s. Understanding these processes should make clear that, while the overall quality of TCP data is very good, some errors will remain and some readable characters will be marked as illegible. Users should bear in mind that in all likelihood such instances will never have been looked at by a TCP editor.</p>
            <p>The texts were encoded and linked to page images in accordance with level 4 of the TEI in Libraries guidelines.</p>
            <p>Copies of the texts have been issued variously as SGML (TCP schema; ASCII text with mnemonic sdata character entities); displayable XML (TCP schema; characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or text strings within braces); or lossless XML (TEI P5, characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or TEI g elements).</p>

               <seg rend="decorInit">I</seg> Cannot conceale (Vertuous &amp; Gra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tious Ladie) the manifolde benefits, that not onely I, but many others of the faithful ſeruants of God haue re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceiued at your graces hand. And for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>aſmuch as I am perſwaded, that the only glory of God &amp; deſire of aduan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cing his trueth, hath beene the chiefe Prouokers of this your goodneſſe: I
<pb facs="tcp:9511:3"/> ſeeno cauſe but that I, both for me ſelfe, and for them, (ſome of them being now a ſleepe in the Lord, &amp; re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſting from their laboures) ſhoulde haue care to ſhew that thankfulnes, &amp; good duetifull encouragement tow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ardes your Grace, that therein your goodneſſe hath iuſtly deſerued. And this is the cauſe why at this time, I am bolde too dedicate theſe poore labours of mine vnto your Grace, as a poore pledge of my humble duety, and a teſtimony too the poſterity of your hearty good will, and vnfained loue, to the glorious trueth of God. And albeit in reſpect of me and my labor, it be moſt vnworthy your gra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tious protection, yet in reſpect of that excellent inſtrument of GOD who wrote it, the matter conteined in it, and the neceſſary vſe of it, for this time, it is not onely worthy your defence, but deſerueth great thankes of the whole Churche of GOD: as geuing light too many harde and doubtfull poyntes, concerning the
<pb facs="tcp:9511:3"/> Sacramentes, and cleerely ſatiſfying the intricate Queſtions of curious demaunders, beſides that it ſtoppeth the mouthes of many carping aduer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſaries both papiſts, and Vbiquitiſtes, who maintayne, I wotte not, what ſtraunge and monſtruous opini<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons.</p>
            <p>And ſurely the knowledge of theſe thinges, how needefull they are too all Chriſtians, may heereby plainely appeare, for that Sathan the father of Lies, and aduerſary of Gods euerla<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſting trueth, beſtirred himſelfe neuer more buſily, for the ouerthrow and corrupting of it, then in this laſt age of the worlde, that partly by the bit<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter inuaſion of craftie and peſtilent Heretikes, &amp; partly by the malice of ignoraunce in many that profeſſe themſelues Chriſtians, hee might e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uen ſwallow vp (if it were poſſible) the moſte beautifull ſpouſe of the Sonne of God. But this is our com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>forte, that hee hath her in keeping who wil preſerue her, who hath taken
<pb facs="tcp:9511:4"/> accompte of her members, and will not looſe one, who will lead her into all trueth, and ſo mightily defende her, that Hell gates ſhall not preuaile againſt her. And too her vnder your name (good Madam) doe I conſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>crate &amp; auow this poore myte for the cauſes aforeſaid, moſt humbly beſee<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ching you too accept of it, with the ſame affection that I offer it. I doe it not after the manner of the worlde, to get or craue any thing: I do it not to puffe you vp to pride and vainglo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry: but to prouok you to good things, that you may goe cheerefully on, in that happy courſe of the Goſpel, wher into by his bou<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>tiful goodnes you are entred. Your Grace now waxeth old, the dayes of your weariſome pilgri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mage paſſe on apace, your continu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>all ſickeneſſe, paynes, and infirmities are meſſengers of preparation too an other and better place. You haue therefore to looke about you, and to ſet all thinges in order towardes that heauenly iourney: Not onely to giue order for thoſe things that concerne
<pb facs="tcp:9511:4"/> the Chriſtian duety of yours, towards that great God, that you may leaue an holy poſterity after you, or at leaſt depart with a cleare conſcience, for hauing perfourmed that duety: but alſo may your ſelfe bee furniſhed of that prouiſion, that may make you ſtande with peace in his ſight.

They that are farre of, ſhalbe ſmitte<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> with the plague and they that are at home, with the ſworde: yea, they that remayne, the famine ſhall conſume them. Where ſhall the wicked ſtand? if they ſcape, the Lyon, a Beare ſhal fal vpon them: and if both Lion and Beare touche them not, yet leaning in theyr owne home vpon the wall, (as the Prophet ſayeth) <hi>An adder ſhall ſting them.</hi> O that the wicked of the worlde, that

<pb facs="tcp:9511:6"/> nowe a long tyme by his worde, by ſignes from heauen, by monſtruous and vnnaturall byrthes, by terrible and fearefull Earthquakes, that wee might leaue of this double dealyng in his ſight, that we might ſerue him vn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>faignedly, not in a ceremony, as the maner of the world is, that we might acknowledge his power, gouernme<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>t and Scepter, to be ruled by him, and to couche downe vnder his hande. We haue had wonderful fiery impreſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſions, vnnaturall ſwelling and fading of waters, ſtraunge and vnknowen Starres, Comets and bloody cloudes, with a late terrible Earthquake: ſuch a one and ſo general, as neither in the remembraunce of our ſelues, nor of our forefathers, the lyke hath beene reade of: but alacke what warning haue we taken by theſe thinges? Ey<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther we attribute them to meere na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture, and ſo leſſen the warninges of God, or els wee quickly forget them, as though they concerned not vs. By the fine deuiſes of deteſtable Epi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cures, and Godleſſe perſons, we make
<pb facs="tcp:9511:7"/> them fal vpon other lands, as though the ſinnes of our lande were exempt from his iudgementes.

And if there bee any thing in vs, it is onely in wordes. The murthers that are committed in the la<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>d daily, are monſtruous, the whor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>domes, inceſt, and Sodomitry moſt beaſtly and outragious, the pryde ſo

O wee faſt and pray: I am very glad of that good forwardneſſe and readineſſe in our Chriſtian Magiſtrates, but I woulde to GOD that wee knewe the true faſte, that wee came not before GOD lyke hypocrites, but as in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtructed and true humbled Chriſti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ans, that theſe ſtrange things might indeede feare vs from our ſinnes, and make vs refourmed from the hearte: then ſhoulde the Calues of our lyppes bee Sacrifices of a ſweete ſauour before our GOD,
<pb facs="tcp:9511:8"/> flowing from a true and liuely Fayth which ſhoulde holde vs vp in a better hope, and ſhoulde worke in vs, both to witnes to others, &amp; to ſeale to our ſelues, that we were no counterfaites, but true Chriſtians. And vnleſſe this effect bee truely wrought in vs, let vs neuer flatter our ſelues, though in ſome colde ſort we vſe theſe outward exerciſes, and bow downe our heads lyke bull ruſhes. No no, God muſt haue a thorowe chaunge wrought in vs, or els he will chaunge our places: we muſt ſauour more of mortificatio<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>, and holines muſt ſhine in ſome mea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſure in vs. Let the worlde therfore, in that ſame godles conte<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>pt of God &amp; his diuine iudgement, ſee what fel vp<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pon their predeceſſours the wicked, that liued in Sodom and Gomorrhe, and would not heare the Preacher of righteouſnes. If they haue the lyke pride, hard heartednes, riot, idlenes, and filthines not to be named, where will they ſtande when the earth ſhall ſinke at Gods iudgements? Was God iuſt in puniſhing the Sichemittes, in
<pb facs="tcp:9511:8"/> hanging vp thoſe twelue Princes, in ſlaying 24000. in the wilderneſſe, in rooting out the Tribe of Beniamin, in deſtroying the ſonnes of Hely, in ba<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>niſhing of Dauid, &amp;c? and will he not puniſh vs, which are ſunke deeper in ſuch tranſgreſſions? But as it is a moſt certaine ſigne of ſpeedy and vnreco<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uerable deſtruction, whe<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> men beſides their ſinnes lyue in all impuritie and contempt of repentaunce: ſo it muſt needes confirme Gods great iudge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment to be at hande, that the worlde is ſo ſecure euery where, and forget<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ful of thoſe wonderful examples, that haue bene in tyme tofore. Before Ba<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bylon becked to deſtruction, GOD ſhooke it with a fearefull Earthquake vnder Sparett, the 17. Kyng of the Aſſyrians. Before that great fire kind<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>led in Grecia vnder Phaeton the Kyng, and after a great Earthquake in Theſſalia, in the tyme of Deucali<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on, as the hyſtoryes report, God de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtroyed all the inhabitauntes thereof. Before thoſe great iudgements were perfourmed towardes Iſraell, that

                  <hi>Amos.</hi> 1.</note> ſent them a fearefull Earthquake in the dayes of Vziah. Oroſius in his ſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>conde Booke and thirteene Chapter, maketh mention of an Earthquake at Rome, when Proculus Geganus Ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cerinus &amp; L. Menenius Lanatus were Conſulles, after which followed ſuch a terrible famine, that many, deſperat through hu<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>ger, caſt themſelues hed<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>long into the Riuer of Tyber. There folowed alſo an outragious peſtile<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>ce after an Earthquake, when Marcus Cornelius Magn. &amp; Lucius Papiri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>us Craſſus were Conſulls. Before that ſame famous Peloponeſiacke warre, that fell out to the deſtruction of the Athenians, there was a terrible Earth<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quake with a continuall fyre ſeene in the ayre for the ſpace of threeſcore &amp; fifteene dayes, at laſt a great ſtone be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing tumbled out of the ayre vpon the Citie. What ſhal I ſpeak of that which ſwallowed vp Helice and Bura, twoo notable Cities, as Euſebius, Eutropi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>us &amp; diuers other Authors witneſſe? Ioſephus in his Booke de Iudaico
<pb facs="tcp:9511:9"/> Bello, maketh mention of an Earth<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quake in Iudea, wherin there periſhed thirtie thouſand people. And Corne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lius Tacitus in his ſecond booke ſaith, that twelue of the moſt notable Cit<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ties in all Aſia were ſwallowed vpp in one night. In the 21. yeare after Chriſt Euſebius affyrmeth that theſe thir<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>teene Cities fell with an Earthquake, Epheſus, Magneſia, Sardis, Moſthe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ne, Mechiero, Caeſarea, Philodelphia, Himulus, Tenus, Cumae, Mirthina, Apollonia, and Diahircania. What ſhould I recken all: before that warre of the Parthians, when Carbulus was Proconſul of Syria: before the de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtruction of cruell Nero, at the death of Titus H. Veſpaſians ſonne, there were terrible Earthquakes, and three famous Cities of Cyprus were ſwal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lowed vpp: foure of Aſia alſo in the tyme of Traian: further two of Gre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cia, and three of Galatia. Oroſ. lib. 7. Cap. 12. Eutrop. Antiochia was ſo ſhaken, that ſcarſely Traian the Em<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>perour eſcaped, read Dion. Nicome<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dian, and a great peece of the Citie of
<pb facs="tcp:9511:10"/> Nice in the time of Adrian, fell by an earthquake: ſo did Nicopôlis and Cae<g ref="char:EOLunhyphen"/>ſarea two famous Cities, after which followed wonderful calamities in the time of Gordian. Tyre &amp; Sydon was by the ſame meanes ouerthrowen, &amp; ſo was many Cities of the Eaſt be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore the hereſies of the Arrians tooke footing in the worlde, when good Athanaſius and other faithful Biſhops and Paſtours were ſo cruelly perſecu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted. I wil ſay nothing of Antiochia, of Neocaeſarea, of Dyrachiu<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>, of Rome, and Ieruſalem it ſelfe: Neither will I ſpeak of nearer tymes. For it were im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſſible to recken all, I referre al god<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly men to the latter wryters alreadie publiſhed, co<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>cerning our late Earth<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quake. This is moſt certaine that it is an vndoubted token of gods diſplea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſure towarde vs, to draw vs to ſpeedy repentaunce. It ſetteth foorth vnto vs the groning of all creatures &amp; of the earth it ſelfe for that reſtauration, which the Sonne of God, Ieſus Chriſt our Sauiour ſhall perfourme at his comming. And I beſeeche God that
<pb facs="tcp:9511:10"/> our heartes may bee ſo ſhaken from the higheſt to the loweſt, that we may call our ſelues to a reckoning of our dayes paſte, to ſhake of our former ſinnes, that wee may mourne before he ſtrike, that he may haue pitie vpon vs, that hee may molifie our ſtony af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fections, to make vs tremble at his preſence: to loue his Goſpell with a more ferue<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>t loue, and to couch down with al obedie<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>ce.

For I pray thee wouldeſt thou paint an hearbe, that thou mightſt repreſent a man to him that woulde be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>holde a man? Very well therefore ſayde <hi>Auguſtine: Vnleſſe</hi> (ſayth he) <hi>the Sa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>craments had ſome likeneſſe of thoſe thinges, they ſignifie they ſhould not be Sacraments.</hi> But of this we ſhal ſee more herafter.

                  <p>God graunt, that at length, we may agree. Therfore heare, I pray thee: It cannot be denied, but that Chriſt accor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ding too his Godhead is euery where. This likewiſe is without all controuer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſie, that foraſmuch as mans nature is ſo taken of the <hi>Woorde,</hi> that GOD and Man are one reall beeyng, it muſt needes followe if thou conſider Chriſte as ſome one, and ſingular thing, that whole Chriſt is alſo euery where pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſent: and yet not as in the Sacra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mentes

                  <p>The other thing that I would haue wel weighed of thee, is this: that which is ſpoken of the whole is not yet ſpo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ken of the ſingular parts, being amo<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>gſt themſelues of a diuerſe kinde.

For heereby it plaine<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly appeareth, that the honour and re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uerence is not referred too thoſe things, becauſe when, the king hath put them off, no man can endure to reuere<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>ce
<pb facs="tcp:9511:46"/> them, vnleſſe he bee out of his wits, but they are reuerenced for another, to wit for the Kinges ſake of whom they are worne.

For they muſt needes come to this poynte, that they muſt confeſſe, that the name of ſpirituall Rocke, was in reſpecte of that very naturall Rocke attributed to Chriſt in reſpect of the bodily Rocke, (that is as they them ſelues interprete

So it is ſayde that the tree of life was planted in Paradiſe, and the tree of the knowledge both of good and euill. And yet was neyther life nor knowledge in thoſe ſame trees, as if thou ſhouldeſt cal a tree the Ague, which either cauſeth an Ague, or els driueth it away: but thoſe ſame trees were onely the effectuall ſignes of theſe ſame ef<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fectes.

And that ſame cupp is called the newe Teſtament in his blood. <hi>Luke</hi> 22. 20. So Baptiſme is called the waſhing of regeneration. <hi>Tit.</hi> 3. 5. So the Church is ſayde to bee purged by the waſhing of water, <hi>Epheſ.</hi> 5. 26. So the outward worde which be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing onely the Chariot as it were of the diuine power, is in many places ſayd to be the word of life and the incorruptible ſeede: and to it is attributed, both clen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſing and ſanctification. So the ſacrifi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ces, are in many places called attone<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments, when notwithſtanding the very blood of Goates and Oxen cannot ſanc<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tifie any.

                  <p>Here I pray thee marke what bold raſhneſſe the ſpirite of error hath in ſclaundering, and what power it hath (when it pleaſeth God) in perſwading. For theſe men affirme, that the figura<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tiue ſpeeches are more obſcure then thoſe that are proper: but contrary<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wiſe they themſelues alſo teach &amp; giue manie preceptes concerning this mat<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter, that Oratours doe verie well vſe figures, not too darken, but to ſet out and make more playne their ſpeeche. Now they are verie well vſed, when they both adorne that that wee woulde haue ſpoken with a certaine dignitie and grace, and better infixe it in the mindes of the hearers, then if any man ſhould vſe a plaine and ſimple ſpeeche.
<pb facs="tcp:9511:74"/> Now foraſmuch as the Sacraments are therefore inſtituted that they may leade our vnderſtanding too an other thing, which by Gods ordinance they ſignifie from that which they are by na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture: or rather, that I may vſe the words of <hi>S. Auguſtine</hi> againſt <hi>Maximinus. Lib. 3. cap,</hi> 18. that wee marke, not what they are, but what they ſet out and ſhewe, becauſe they are ſignes of thinges ſhewing one thing and ſigni<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fying another: who ſeeth not that the nature and vſe of the Sacramentes is much better fixed in the minde of the hearer, when the ſignes are ſayd to bee the thing it ſelfe that they ſigni<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fie?</p>
                  <p>Let vs ſet downe for example ſake, that we may dwell ſtill vpon the former example that the Maior or Ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>giſtrate of a Towne or Citie of whom poſſeſſion is giuen vnto thee of ſome houſe deliuering thee a key vpon this condition, and ſpeaking vnto thee after this manner, this keye is that ſame houſe ſtanding in that place, which

Now this reaſon is ſet out by <hi>Theodoret.</hi> in his <hi>Eraniſta</hi> in theſe woords, <hi>Chriſt would</hi> (ſayth he) <hi>that they that would bee partakers of theſe diuine my<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſteries</hi> (for he ſpeaketh of the Supper of the Lorde) <hi>ſhould take heede not to conſider the nature of the thinges which they ſee, but through this change of names</hi> (to witte whereby it is brought to paſſe, that the name of the thing ſignified is giuen vntoo the ſigne) <hi>they ſhoulde giue credite vntoo that change which is wrought by grace:</hi> That is, they ſhoulde conſider that thing, not as it is by nature, but howe by Gods com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>maundement it is vſed too ſignifie, that thing.

<pb facs="tcp:9511:101"/> Magiſtrate. But the Lawyers do more ſubtilly diſtinguiſh betweene him who is a Magiſtrate, (to wit, a lawful one) and him who is in the Magiſtracie: as when they diſpute that it is one thing too bee Proconſull, and another thing too bee in the Proconſulſhippe: another thing to be Pretor, then to ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceriſe the Office of the Pretorſhip, as is ſayde of <hi>Barbarius Philippus:</hi> ano<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther thing too bee Tutor, then too ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>erciſe the office of Tutorſhippe: in ſo muche as that ſometimes hee that is a Magiſtrate (as for example if hee bee an outragious man) may bee a Ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>giſtrate indeede but yet hee can not ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ecute the Office of a Magiſtrate. The faulte is in the act when it is not orde<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dered rightly, that is to ſay, when ſuche things are omitted w<hi rend="sup">c</hi> are of the nature of the act it ſelfe. Nowe in the Papiſti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>call Baptiſme, the faulte is not in the act in which that ſame principal forme is kept, which other ſtrange and ſuper<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fluous thinges cannot hurte, but the faulte is in the perſon, for they are an<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nexed to the Biſhops &amp; too the Elders,
<pb facs="tcp:9511:101"/> But this fault cannot hurte the action. For (that I may come more neere too our Diuines) they that are not law<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fully called vnto the miniſtery, and yet notwithſtanding ſitte in the chayre of the Miniſterie, by the conſent of ſome men (although deceiued) albeit in reſpecte of the Perſons themſelues, they bee not true Paſtoures, yet not<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>withſtanding they are to be accounted in another place the<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> they that haue nei<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther lawfull nor vnlawfull calling. So <hi>Caiphas</hi> indeede was not the lawfull high prieſt, becauſe he had by giuing of money entred into the high Prieſthood, yet notwithſta<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>ding ſitting in the chaire of the highe Prieſthood, (albeit vna<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wares) he vttereth a Propheſie. And before this Biſhop ſitting in his ſeate, the Lord goeth to the temple and obſer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ueth thoſe diuine ceremonies that were not yet aboliſhed. So the Phariſies ſo farre foorth as they ſate in Moyſes chayre, are commaunded too be heard, which Chayre notwithſta<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>ding the moſt of them had gotten by ambition and euill meanes.

<pb facs="tcp:9511:102"/> man accounted a Magiſtrate comman<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>deth, albeit hee were promoted thither by euill indeuours, which it is certayne happened vnto one <hi>Barbarius Philip<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pus</hi> a ſeruant, and yet notwithſtanding through error created Pretor of Rome. To conclude a faulty vocatio<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>, may hurt the co<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>ſcience of him who hath violently broken in vppon that office, but it doeth not defile thoſe thinges which are done of him as if he were lawfully called.</p>

                  <p>Here in a maner it is incredible to be ſpoken, howe great confuſion was brought into the Churches vnder the ſhewe of order, and ſpecially into the Greeke Churches. For it is certayne, by the Acts of the Apoſtles, that at the beginning, baptiſme was miniſtred as occaſion was offred: they for the moſte parte which came vnto Baptiſme bee<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing rather endued with Faith in Chriſt by miracle, then by any order of the in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtitution. Afterwardes as it ſpecially appeareth by the ſeconde Defenſory o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ration of Iuſtinus, the holy Ghoſt be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ginning to woorke by litle and litle by ordinary means, when the congregati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons were gathered together, baptiſme was miniſtred. Afterwardes that all things might be done in order, inſtruc<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ters being ordeyned, two dayes were at the firſt by a certayne cuſtome, then by lawe, and at length as it were by a cer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>taine ſuperſtition appointed for the bap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tizing of thoſe that were ſo inſtructed. Nowe at the length, it was brought to this paſſe, that it was in a maner comp<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted
<pb facs="tcp:9511:106"/> a great treſpaſſe to baptize at any o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther time then at Eaſter and at Whit<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſontide. Further vnder the cullour of this order appointed, to the end that they that were catechized (ſuche as were in the beginning all thoſe that were to be baptiſed as well of the Iewes as of the Gentiles) ſhould not be called e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uery day, nor before a lawful profeſſion: it is in a manner incredible to thinke what confuſions were pulled intoo the church eſpecially, for that cauſe becauſe that whereas baptiſme in thoſe ſame that were of the yeeres of diſcretion, was the firſt entrance intoo the congre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gation of the Church, they coulde not preciſely wayte for the ſett time of Eaſter and Whitſontide, but they muſt thinke themſelues after a ſort condem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ned, who in the meane ſeaſon fell into the daunger of death. And heerevpon that, alſo enſued that they were bounde too diſcharge an infinite number from thoſe Lawes, who alſo pretended o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther thinges. So crept in that ſame errour to the abſolute neceſſitie of bap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tiſme, which opinion when it ſeemed

Firſt be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cauſe in any identicall propoſition, that is, where the ſame thing is affirmed of the ſelfe ſame, the Subiect &amp; the predi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cate muſt not differ in the thing, but in the name onely: as when I ſay a blade is a ſworde, as a target is a ſhield, the ſonne of the virgin is Chriſt, but bread and the body of Chriſt are not words of the ſame ſignification, but thinges alto<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>geather diuers: therefore they make not
<pb facs="tcp:9511:141"/> an identicall Propoſition. But if nowe<note place="margin">An identicall propoſition is a propoſition af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>firmatiue of it ſelfe.</note> ſome froward perſon will haue one and the ſame ſubſtance too bee declared in theſe two words, firſt ye muſt ſhew that neither bread ceaſeth to be bread, nor y<hi rend="sup">e</hi> the bodie ceaſeth to be a bodie. Further<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>more in a propoſition Identical, the ſub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>iect and predicate are conuertible, or ſtanding one for an other. Therefore if this propoſition were identicall or one, the bodie of Chriſt might as truely bee ſaid to be baked in an Ouen, as it is tru<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly ſaide that bread is the body giuen for vs. Therfore it is not as the ſchoolemen ſpeake, an identicall propoſition.</p>
                  <p>Now againe, that nothing diuers, is herein naturally ſaid, is thus prooued by a neceſſary conſequence. If the body as ſome thing diuers ſhould bee regulerly ſpoken of bread, ſurely eyther it ſhould be ſpoken eſſentially, or as the cauſe, or as accidentary. We haue ſhewed in the ſeconde argument that it is not ſpoken eſſentially, as neither being vnto breade as the <hi>general,</hi> or as the <hi>difference,</hi> nor as the <hi>ſpecial,</hi> in reſpect of the <hi>ſingular.</hi> Now it can much leſſe be the cauſal af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>firmation.
<pb facs="tcp:9511:141"/> For neither hath a bodie the reaſon in reſpect of bread, of the effici<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ent cauſe, nor of the end: but the inward cauſes, to wyt, the matter and fourme are referred to the eſſential affirmation. Finally, it can not bee any accidentall affirmation, for as much as the body is no accident, yea and though it were, yet it can not be an accident to bread.</p>
                  <p>It remaineth therefore, that by ney<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther of both wayes, that ſame can be, ei<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther a naturall or a proper Propoſiti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on.</p>

                  <p>I geather out of other places of the ſcripture, that this is not a proper pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſition.

                  <p>It is geathered not darkely out of <hi>Iohn</hi> the 17. 3. that Fayth is the know<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ledge of the true God &amp; of Ieſus Chriſt, whereby we are ſaued.

                  <p>It is playne that <hi>Herode</hi> was pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>perly a man. The ſame alſo is called a Foxe, one of theſe therefore muſt be vn<g ref="char:EOLunhyphen"/>derſtoode to be ſpoken figuratiuely.

                  <p>I would anſweare that both Chriſt and Paule paſſed this ouer as a thing ſufficiently knowen. For to what pur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſe ſhoulde he haue taught his Diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ciples, that that bread which he held in his handes, was breade, and that wine? But vndoubtedly it behooued him to teach them that, which other<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wiſe they woulde neuer haue belee<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ued, too witte, that thoſe thinges alſo which hee helde in his handes and gaue them, in, vnder, or with Bread and Wyne: was his body and his blood.</p>

But to what ende is this: For theſe fourmes, which are called diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cerning fourmes, becauſe they doe diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cerne the ſpecials of the ſame generall, they doe not take away the conſtituting in which of neceſſitie all the ſpecialls muſt be conſtituted, that they may bee referred to the common general. So for example ſake, a liuing creature is the common eſſential fourme, and ſubſtance of all fourmes perteyning to that gen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der. Now reaſon is the fourme, where<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>by man is ſundred from all other kindes of liuing creatures. Nowe wilt thou ſay that this ſame ſpeciall fourme doth bring to paſſe that that ſame generall (to wit, liuing creature) ſhould not be layde altogether by the ſame reaſon of man and of other liuing creatures: And
<pb facs="tcp:9511:152"/> I pray thee, how if that which is called <hi>differentia</hi> or <hi>proprium:</hi> for nowe I doe not diſtinguiſh betwixt theſe, ſhould al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>together take away the ſame attributi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on of gender, ſhould the diſtinction con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſiſt of gender and difference: Therfore that ſame ſpeciall difference of the lords Supper whatſoeuer it be, can not bring to paſſe that that ſame common reaſon which maketh a Sacrament, altoge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther by the ſame meane, ſhould leſſe be ſpoken of the Lords Supper, then of other Sacramentes. Nowe that ſame common reaſon, as we haue ſhewed, is that the outwarde ſigne ſhould ſignifie a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nother thing ſacramentally. Nowe no<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thing is a ſigne of it ſelfe, foraſmuch as a ſigne is in the kynde of thoſe thinges which are conferred with another, ther<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore that ſame remaineth common with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out exception to all Sacraments, that the thing ſignified is not the ſigne: be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cauſe theſe two muſt bee in very deede, and therefore the thing ſignified, can not be ſayde of the ſigne but tranſitiuely.</p>

                  <p>Firſte, becauſe the Supper of the Lorde is not a priuate action of anye houſhold, but meere eccleſiaſticall: and therefore that ſame domeſtical Lambe, was ſlaine in Iſrael, that yet notwith<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtanding it ſhoulde not bee done at any other time, then when all Iſrael did ce<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lebrate this myſtery.

But I ſuppoſe that the Paſtours ought neceſſarily to knowe the ſheepe e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uen by the ſame order that reaſon it ſelfe hath appointed. Firſt therfore for auoy<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ding of prophanation, I think that with a good conſcience ſtraungers are not to be admitted, altogether vnknowen to the Paſtour: Moreouer thoſe whom age it ſelfe ſheweth not to be fit to make exa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mination of them ſelues, indeede not as vnworthie, but to bee warned as yet not fit, leaſt they heape vppon them ſelues damnation. But of thoſe that are grow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>en in yeeres none to be admitted, vnleſſe hee haue firſt after a ſort rendred a rea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſon of his Fayth, as one not onely borne in the Church of God, but as ſuch a one of whome the Paſtour may probably coniecture, to be a Chriſtian, who muſt render account of all his ſheepe before the Lorde. Laſt of all, I would accompt thoſe for ſtrangers by the word of God, whoſe hypocriſie by the iuſt and lawfull iudgement of the Eccleſiaſticall preſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bytery ſhalbe conuicted to be ſuch, that for a tyme they ſhall be inhibited from

I ſay and am ready to prooue, that this hath bene the order alwayes kept, euen vntill theſe tymes euer ſince the Church be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gan, of ſeuering the prophane from the holy, and reuealed hypocrites from the reſt of profeſſors of Chriſtian religion.</p>
